-- Preparing the DDIs of production studies: 
----------------------------------------------
The DDIs of the released (published) studies are already exported and available
on disk (but do make sure they are all exported properly, and re-run export-all 
if necessary). The DDIs for the non-released versions need to be re-exported
using the DVN DDI export servlet. 

1. The following script goes through the list of the studies in the prod. db, 
and does the following 2 things:

For non-released versions, issues a call to the export servlet and saves the 
DDI in ddi/<DV alias>/<STUDY ID>-<VERSION NUMBER>.xml

It also generates a "packing list" of the DDI files for the released versions,
on the standard output. (this will be packed in the next step)


./versions_source_ "http://<DVN 3.6 HOSTNAME>/dvn/ddi" > DDI_released_packlist.txt

2. To pack the released DDIs:
(this step needs to be run on a system that has access to the production filesystem!)

cat DDI_released_packlist.txt | ./versions_source_step2_

This will copy all the published version DDIs, identified in the previous step, 
into /tmp/ddi, as
/tmp/ddi/<DV alias>/<STUDY ID>.xml

The contents of /tmp/ddi/* should now be packaged and mixed with the non-released 
ddis saved in step 1.
